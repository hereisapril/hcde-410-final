This project aims to confirm that fake news spreads six times faster than truthful news and research how much faster more extreme fake news spreads than mild fake news. 

This project uses the ESOC COVID-19 Misinformation Dataset (published by the Princeton University Empirical Studies of Conflict):https://esoc.princeton.edu/publications/esoc-covid-19-misinformation-dataset 

There have been many studies done around the spread of fake news:

to name a few. These articles express how dangerous fake news can be and why it's such an issue today with social media and our personal data sorting us into closed bubbles that just repeatedly feed our political preferences back to us and pull us even further to each of our political sides.
